The introduction of this conversational search tool addresses the significant challenge of navigating a growing repository of medical databases. This system enables users to engage in natural language dialogue, significantly reducing the time and complexity traditionally associated with identifying suitable databases for research studies. Moreover, the system reflects a deep understanding of the needs within the medical research community for reliable, up-to-date, and accessible data.

In conclusion, the successful implementation of this system represents a significant advancement in the field of data discovery and retrieval. It not only simplifies the process of identifying the most relevant databases but also empowers researchers, regardless of their prior experience with database search tools. However, some future work remains, namely enhancing the IR methods to produce better results, considering synonyms.
